## Try our demos on Huggingface Space

Apart from the [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.01368), there are two new features in PyABSA: Aspect sentiment triplet
extraction and Aspect quadruple extraction.
We have deployed the demos on Huggingface Space, you can try them online.

- **[Aspect sentiment quadruple extraction](https://huggingface.co/spaces/yangheng/PyABSA) (English) New feature**
- **[Aspect sentiment triplet extraction](https://huggingface.co/spaces/yangheng/PyABSA) (English) New feature**

## Usage Examples

We have prepared many examples for different tasks. Please refer to [Examples](./examples-v2) for more usage examples.

## Installation

### install via pip

To use PyABSA, install the latest version from pip or source code:

```bash
pip install -U pyabsa
```

### install via source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yangheng95/PyABSA --depth=1
cd PyABSA 
python setup.py install
```

## Quick-Start

### Extract aspect terms and classify sentiments

```python3
from pyabsa import AspectTermExtraction as ATEPC, available_checkpoints

# you can view all available checkpoints by calling available_checkpoints()
checkpoint_map = available_checkpoints()

aspect_extractor = ATEPC.AspectExtractor('multilingual',
                                         auto_device=True,  # False means load model on CPU
                                         cal_perplexity=True,
                                         )

# instance inference
aspect_extractor.predict(['I love this movie, it is so great!'],
                         save_result=True,
                         print_result=True,  # print the result
                         ignore_error=True,  # ignore the error when the model cannot predict the input
                         )

inference_source = ATEPC.ATEPCDatasetList.Restaurant16
atepc_result = aspect_extractor.batch_predict(target_file=inference_source,  #
                                              save_result=True,
                                              print_result=True,  # print the result
                                              pred_sentiment=True,  # Predict the sentiment of extracted aspect terms
                                              )

print(atepc_result)


```

### Aspect-based sentiment analysis

```python3
from pyabsa import AspectPolarityClassification as APC, available_checkpoints

# you can view all available checkpoints by calling available_checkpoints()
checkpoint_map = available_checkpoints(show_ckpts=True)

classifier = APC.SentimentClassifier('multilingual',
                                     auto_device=True,  # False means load model on CPU
                                     cal_perplexity=True,
                                     )

# instance inference
classifier.predict(['I love this movie, it is so great!'],
                   save_result=True,
                   print_result=True,  # print the result
                   ignore_error=True,  # ignore the error when the model cannot predict the input
                   )

inference_source = APC.APCDatasetList.Laptop14
apc_result = classifier.batch_predict(target_file=inference_source,  #
                                      save_result=True,
                                      print_result=True,  # print the result
                                      pred_sentiment=True,  # Predict the sentiment of extracted aspect terms
                                      )

print(apc_result)

```
